## Welcome to my personal website!

Welcome to my personal website! Iâ€™m Alexander Radchenko, a passionate advocate for automation and efficiency. 
I believe in the power of disassembling complex systems to uncover their core functionalities and reassembling them in a way that enhances performance and productivity. 
My journey in robotics and machine learning is driven by this philosophy, as I strive to create intelligent solutions that simplify life and work.

As a current Masters student in Robotics at the University of Pennsylvania, 
I specialize in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, applying these cutting-edge technologies to the field of robotics. 
My academic excellence is reflected in my 3.9 GPA, and my hands-on experience includes a dissertation that achieved state-of-the-art results in language reasoning with visual cues.

My technical skills are diverse, encompassing programming languages like Python, Java, C, and C++, 
as well as expertise in data science and machine learning tools such as PyTorch, Pandas, and HuggingFace. 
Iâ€™ve also demonstrated my abilities in game and web development, with projects like the Graviton Android game and Unreal Engine plugins that have garnered significant attention.

I invite you to explore my site:
